# Project: Smart Route Re-Router

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide a software solution for rerouting in critical situations. The system detects when a reroute is required, prompts the user, awaits confirmation from the head office, and then sends the updated route to passengers. Currently, this application demonstrates functionality on a single route.

## Features and Functionality
- Detects when a reroute is required based on predetermined conditions.
- Prompts the user with an option to confirm the reroute.
- Sends an updated route to passengers upon receiving confirmation from the head office.
- Currently supports one route in this demo version.

## Proving Efficiency

Our solution aims to improve transit efficiency by:
- Reducing delays through timely and accurate reroutes.
- Facilitating swift decision-making by involving the head office in real time.
- Enhancing passenger experience with immediate updates during critical events.

## Built With
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start` - Starts the app in development mode.
- `npm test` - Launches the test runner.
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production.
