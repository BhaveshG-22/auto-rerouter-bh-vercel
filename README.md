# 🚌 Project: Smart Route Re-Router

## 🗺️ Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide a software solution for rerouting in critical transit situations. The system detects when a bus reroute is required, prompts the user, awaits confirmation from the transit control center, and then sends the updated route to passengers. Currently, this application demonstrates functionality on a single bus route.

## 🚍 Features and Functionality
- Detects when a reroute is required based on road conditions and traffic.
- Prompts the transit operator with an option to confirm the reroute.
- Sends an updated bus route to passengers upon receiving confirmation from the transit control center.
- Currently supports one route in this demo version.

## 📈 Proving Efficiency

Our solution aims to improve transit efficiency by:
- 🕒 Reducing delays through timely and accurate reroutes.
- 🏢 Facilitating swift decision-making by involving the transit control center in real time.
- 🚏 Enhancing passenger experience with immediate updates during critical events.
